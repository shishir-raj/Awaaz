The way through the woods / Rudyard Kipling
They shut the road through the woods

Seventy years ago,

Weather and rain have undone it again,

And now you would never know,

There was once a road through the woods

Before they planted the trees.

It is underneath the coppice and heath, 

And the thin anemones. 

Only the keeper sees 

That, where the ring-dove broods,

And the badgers roll at ease,

There was once a road through the wood. 



Yet, if you enter the woods 

Of a summer evening late,

When the night-air cools on the 

trout-ringed pools 

Where the otter whistles his mate,

(They fear not men in the woods,

Because they see so few.)

You will hear the beat of a horse's feet, 

And the swish of a skirt in the dew,

Steadily cantering through 

The misty solitudes, 

As though they perfectly knew 

The old lost road through the woods... 

But there is no road through the woods!
