The Suicide's Argument / Samuel Taylor Coleridge
Ere the birth of my life, if I wished it or noNo question was asked me--it could not be so!If the life was the question, a thing sent to tryAnd to live on be YES; what can NO be? to die.NATURE'S ANSWERIs't returned, as 'twas sent? Is't no worse for the wear?Think first, what you ARE! Call to mind what you WERE!I gave you innocence, I gave you hope,Gave health, and genius, and an ample scope,Return you me guilt, lethargy, despair?Make out the invent'ry; inspect, compare!Then die—if die you dare!
