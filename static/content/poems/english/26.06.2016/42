A Red, Red Rose / Robert Burns
O my Luve's like a red, red rose 
That's newly sprung in June: 
O my Luve's like the melodie 
That's sweetly play'd in tune! 

As fair thou art, my bonnie lass, 
So deep in love am I: 
And I will love thee still, my dear, 
Till a' the seas gang dry: 

Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear, 
And the rocks melt with the sun; 
I will luve thee still my dear, 
When the sands of life shall run. 

And fare thee weel, my only Luve, 
And fare thee weel a while! 
And I will come again , my Luve, 
Tho' it were ten thousand mile.
