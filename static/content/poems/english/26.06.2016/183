Abode Of The Beloved / Kabir
Oh Companion That Abode Is Unmatched, 
Where My Complete Beloved Is. 

In that Place There Is No Happiness or Unhappiness, 
No Truth or Untruth 
Neither Sin Nor Virtue. 
There Is No Day or Night, No Moon or Sun, 
There Is Radiance Without Light. 

There Is No Knowledge or Meditation 
No Repetition of Mantra or Austerities, 
Neither Speech Coming From Vedas or Books. 
Doing, Not-Doing, Holding, Leaving 
All These Are All Lost Too In This Place. 

No Home, No Homeless, Neither Outside or Inside, 
Micro and Macrocosm Are Non-Existent. 
Five Elemental Constituents and the Trinity Are Both Not There 
Witnessing Un-struck Shabad Sound is Also Not There. 

No Root or Flower, Neither Branch or Seed, 
Without a Tree Fruits are Adorning, 
Primordial Om Sound, Breath-Synchronized Soham, 
This and That - All Are Absent, The Breath Too Unknown 

Where the Beloved Is There is Utterly Nothing 
Says Kabir I Have Come To Realize. 
Whoever Sees My Indicative Sign 
Will Accomplish the Goal of Liberation.
