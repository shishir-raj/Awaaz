Poetry on veena / S.R. Girish Kumar
A status close to godliness

Mesmerising the audience

An atistocrat among instruments

With science as compliment

Producing the most number of hormonics

It gives soothing music

Its four strings represending four Vedas

And fluendly four frets give it the Nada. 

Its structure symbolising human body

Goddess Saraswati keeps it handy

A treasure of ages

Fondly played by sages

VEENA is its name

Salutations to its divine fame.
