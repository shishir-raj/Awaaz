A night in june / William Wordsworth

The sun has long been set. 

The stars are out by twos and threes. 

The little birds are piping yet

Among the bushes and trees. 

There’s a cuckoo and one or two thrushes

And a far-off wind that rushes

And a sound of water that gushes

And the cuckoo’s sovereign cry

Fills all the hollow of the sky.
