So We'll Go No More A-Roving / George Gordon Byron
So we'll go no more a-rovingSo late into the night,
Though the heart still be as loving,And the moon still be as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-rovingBy the light of the moon.
