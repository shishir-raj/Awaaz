Good-Night / Percy Bysshe Shelley
I.Good-night? ah! no; the hour is illWhich severs those it should unite;Let us remain together still,Then it will be GOOD night.II.How can I call the lone night good, Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?Be it not said, thought, understood--Then it will be--GOOD night.III.To hearts which near each other moveFrom evening close to morning light, The night is good; because, my love,They never SAY good-night.
