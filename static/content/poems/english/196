Palanquin Bearers / Sarojini Naidu
Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,  She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;  She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,  She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.  Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,  We bear her along like a pearl on a string.  Softly, O softly we bear her along,  She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;  She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,  She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.  Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,  We bear her along like a pearl on a string.
