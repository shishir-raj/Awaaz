A Woman's Last Word / Robert Browning
I.

Let's contend no more, Love, Strive nor weep:
All be as before, Love, —-Only sleep!

II.

What so wild as words are? I and thou
In debate, as birds are, Hawk on bough!

III.

See the creature stalking While we speak!
Hush and hide the talking, Cheek on cheek!

IV.

What so false as truth is, False to thee?
Where the serpent's tooth is Shun the tree—-

V.

Where the apple reddens Never pry—-
Lest we lose our Edens, Eve and I.

VI.

Be a god and hold me With a charm!
Be a man and fold me With thine arm!

VII.

Teach me, only teach, Love As I ought
I will speak thy speech, Love, Think thy thought—-

VIII.

Meet, if thou require it, Both demands,
Laying flesh and spirit In thy hands.

IX.

That shall be to-morrow Not to-night:
I must bury sorrow Out of sight:

X

—-Must a little weep, Love, (Foolish me!)
And so fall asleep, Love, Loved by thee.
