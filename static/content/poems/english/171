Chicago / Carl Sandburg
HOG Butcher for the World,Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler; Stormy, husky, brawling,City of the Big Shoulders:
They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for Ihave seen your painted women under the gas lampsluring the farm boys.
And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, itis true I have seen the gunman kill and go free tokill again.
And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On thefaces of women and children I have seen the marksof wanton hunger.
And having answered so I turn once more to those whosneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneerand say to them:
Come and show me another city with lifted head singingso proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cun-ning.
Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job onjob, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against thelittle soft cities;
Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunningas a savage pitted against the wilderness,Bareheaded,Shoveling,Wrecking,Planning,Building, breaking, rebuilding,
Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing withwhite teeth,
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a youngman laughs,
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who hasnever lost a battle,
Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse,and under his ribs the heart of the people, Laughing!
Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter ofYouth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be HogButcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player withRailroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.
